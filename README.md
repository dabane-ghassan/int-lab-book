- My personal lab-notebook for my internship at the Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone [(INT, Marseille, France)](http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/).
- Supervised by [Emmanuel DaucÃ©](http://emmanuel.dauce.free.fr/) (MC, Ecole Centrale Marseille).
- Description of my internship project:

> In contrast with computer vision, biological vision is characterized by an anisotropic sensor (**The Retina**) as well as the ability to **move** the eyesight to   different locations in the visual scene through ocular **saccades**. To better understand how the human eye analyzes visual scenes, a bio-inspired artificial  vision  model was recently suggested by ***DaucÃ© et al (2020) <sup>1</sup>***.The goal of this masterâ€™s internship would be to compare the results obtained by DaucÃ© et   al with some of the more classical attentional computer vision models like the ***Spatial transformer network <sup>2</sup>*** where the visual input undergoes a foveal   deformation.
